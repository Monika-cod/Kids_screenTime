📊 Indian Kids Screen Time & Health Impact Dashboard

📌 Overview

An interactive Power BI dashboard built on a Kaggle dataset with 9000+ rows and 7+ attributes, analyzing screen time habits of Indian kids and their associated health impacts. This project uncovers key patterns across demographics, devices, and health issues to support awareness and decision-making.

🎯 Goals and Purpose

The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of screen time among Indian kids and its associated health impacts using a Kaggle dataset of over 9000 records. It explores average daily screen usage, device preferences, demographic variations between urban and rural areas, and differences across gender. The dashboard also highlights the most common health issues linked to prolonged screen time, such as poor sleep, anxiety, and eye strain. By presenting these insights visually, the dashboard supports parents, educators, researchers, and policymakers in promoting healthier digital habits and making informed decisions for child well-being.
1. Measure daily average screen time across demographics.
2. Identify most used devices (TV, smartphones, etc.).
3. Examine urban vs rural differences.
4. Highlight health issues linked to screen exposure.

Bussiness Problems 

1. Rising screen time among children is a growing health and behavioral concern.
2. Overuse of devices like smartphones, TVs, and laptops may cause negative health impacts.
3. Common issues include poor sleep, anxiety, eye strain, and reduced physical activity.
4. Lack of structured data makes it difficult to study urban vs rural, gender, and age-wise patterns.
5. There is a need to analyze large datasets (like this Kaggle data of 9000+ records) to uncover screen usage trends and health correlations.
